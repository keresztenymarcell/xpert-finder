# Xpert Finder

## About

My last team work project from Codecool which I did in the Java specialization branch. It took 5 sprints to implement, We had to come up with our own project idea, and we decided to build a web application where you can search for experts based on the location and the services they provide.
Experts can register and advertise their services, and normal users can post reviews about them based on the work quality. We built a Spring Boot RestAPI as the Backend of the app, and ReactJS on the Frontend to build a dynamic web application.
